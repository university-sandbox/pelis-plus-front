# Development Phases — Pelis Plus

This document tracks the implementation progress of every feature defined in `flujos_plataforma_cine.md`.
Check each task off as it is completed.

## Conventions

- **Code language**: English — file names, variables, functions, classes, types, comments, route paths, selectors.
- **UI language**: Spanish — all text visible to the end user (labels, buttons, errors, titles, placeholders).
- **Payments**: handled entirely by **Izipay**. Use the sandbox environment for development and demo. The app never collects or stores raw card data.
- **Data layer**: components never call `HttpClient` directly — all HTTP goes through a service. All endpoint paths live in `src/core/api/endpoints.ts` (see `docs/api.md`).
- **Mock-first**: during frontend-only development services return typed mock data. Swapping to real calls = updating `endpoints.ts` + replacing the mock return in the service method.
- **UI/UX**: every screen needs skeleton loaders, all interactive states (hover, focus, disabled, loading, error, empty), and mobile-first layout starting at 375 px.

## Phase 13 — Quality, Accessibility & Polish

> E2e tests using `playwright-cli` must be written alongside each feature — not deferred to this phase.
> This phase covers cross-cutting concerns and final audits only.

### Accessibility
92. - [ ] Run AXE checks on all public pages and fix every violation
93. - [ ] Verify WCAG AA contrast on all color combinations
94. - [ ] Add focus management for modals, drawers, and route transitions
95. - [ ] Add missing ARIA labels, roles, and live regions

### UI completeness
96. - [ ] Verify skeleton loaders are present on every async screen
97. - [ ] Verify all interactive states exist on every component (hover, focus, disabled, loading, error, empty)
98. - [ ] Add global error pages: 404, 500, and generic fallback

### Unit tests
99. - [ ] Write unit tests for all services (AuthService, CartService, PaymentService, MembershipService, etc.)

### E2e — final regression suite (playwright-cli)
100. - [ ] Full critical path: register → browse catalog → select screening → pick seats → add snacks → checkout (Izipay sandbox) → view ticket
101. - [ ] Auth edge cases: login with invalid credentials, expired session redirect
102. - [ ] Seat selection edge cases: sold-out screening, reservation timeout
103. - [ ] Cart edge cases: remove item, apply membership discount
104. - [ ] Admin happy path: create movie → create screening → view order

### Performance
105. - [ ] Audit bundle size and apply lazy loading where missing
106. - [ ] Test SSR hydration and verify no hydration mismatch errors
